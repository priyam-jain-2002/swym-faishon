# Hi Swym👋
This project is with refrence to task Analyzing Product Reviews.
Here we are focusing on two questions asked in the problem statement 

1. Global Promoter 
2. Product with most positive reviews 
 
We are generating a model which efficiently generates answers to the above questions, I first of all merged the data set for important columns and used plotly for generation of graphs and run data analysis in order to effectively understand data.

Next we added spacy's sentiment analysis model on review tab in order to generate a score which tells us if a sentiment is in positive or negative for a review. 

Then i used basic Data structutre analysis in order to correctly answer the questions.
